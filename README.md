## 📌 Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to build a **Linear Regression** model to accurately predict house prices in **King County**, USA. The dataset includes features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and more. 

📈 This helps potential buyers and real estate professionals estimate property values based on historical data.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and explored real-world housing data
- Removed duplicates, unnecessary columns, and handled missing data
- Visualized key relationships (e.g. price vs living area)
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using **Mean Squared Error** and **R² score**
- Visualized results and residuals
